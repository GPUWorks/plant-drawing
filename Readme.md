# Plant Drawing Using L-Systems

*The complete documentation can be found [here](./doc/Overview.html)*

This project was made as a part of the Computer Graphics course (IS F311) offered at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. It features graphical rendering of trees using Lindenmayer Systems. The trees are composed entirely of straight lines and circles, which are themselves drawn using Bresenham's Midpoint Algorithm.

The project is written entirely in C++, using the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) for all graphical rendering needs. Certain third party libraries which complement OpenGL are also used, consisting of but not limited to [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) and [GLAD](http://glad.dav1d.de/).

The program can be evaluated by running the .exe file in the root folder of the project.
